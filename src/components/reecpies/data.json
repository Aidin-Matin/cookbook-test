          "description": "Tofu can get a bad rap as a meat substitute, but it’s actually an incredibly versatile ingredient. When blended, it has a great creamy texture – you can use it in a vegan mousse or pudding, and it’s essential for making a creamy ricotta substitute in my lasagna and vegan stuffed shells. Most often, I bake it to add protein and hearty texture to bowls, noodles, and salads.",

You’ll know they’re done when the juices run clear, they’re no longer pink in the center, and an instant-read thermometer reads at least 165 degrees F.",
